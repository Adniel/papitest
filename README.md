zato.apitest - API Testing for Humans
=====================================

Intro
-----

zato.apitest is a friendly command line tool for creating beautiful tests of HTTP-based REST, XML and SOAP APIs with as little
hassle as possible.

Tests are written in plain English, with no programming needed, and can be trivially extended in Python if need be.

Here's how a built-in demo test case looks like:
